Hello I am ScrewchMcMuffin, I am basically into web-development, both frontend and backend. I am a all about Javascript.
dont't dare mention with me C#, urgh... Obviously I use nodejs and will eventually experiment with deno as well.

What I want to do is multiplayer games on the browser.

Technologies I am pursuing are:
- Nodejs
- WebComponents
- Babylonjs (it rocks!)
- Colyseus.io
- And MORE

Repositories in this account will reflect experimentation with these technologies and modules which will provide a higher
level of abtraction when using these thecnologies.
